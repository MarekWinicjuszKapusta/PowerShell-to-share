Hi,
In this repository you can find my scripts that i made to ease life of Service Desk Agents (+myself).

Feel free to use them.

Delete Local Cached profile:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Script with GUI to remove local cached profile from remote machine.
  RSAT is needed to check if computer asset is avilable as AD object.
  Tested for PowerShell 5.1

  Instruction:
  1. Press 'Set'  button, and enter asset tag.
     If font changed to red, asset was not found in Active Directory.
     You can also enter IPv4, but font will also change to red.
    
  2. Press 'Load' to fill ListView window with profiles found on computer.
    
  3. Hover pointer over username of the profile that you want to delete, and perform right click mouse operation.
    
  4. Select 'Delete Profile'
     Profile can be deleted only if 'Loaded' is set to 'False', that means user was fully signed out.
     If user 'Loaded' status is set to 'True' even after sign out, restart machine, and then after user gets to logon screen, press          'Load' button once again.
     
     
AD Compare:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Script with GUI to manage Active direcory objects, specially usefull when we want to generate RSOP or compare membership of 2 objects.
  RSAT is needed.
  Tested for PowerShell 5.1
  
  Instruction:
    Press set button to enter AD object (primary user, equivalent user, primary computer or equivalent computer).
    Press load to drop data from AD on ListView.
    Press "users" to compare primary and equivalent user groups.
    Press "comp" to compare primary and equivalent computer groups.
    To display context menu, press right mouse action when pointer hover over ListView.
    All function buttons are working, so feel free to test them.
